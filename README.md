# Silius

_Account Abstraction has for a long time been a dream of the Ethereum developer community._

_**- Vitalik Buterin**_

### Introduction

**Silius** is an [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) (account abstraction) bundler implementation in a highly efficient and safe programming language Rust. But there's more; it's design and architecture are:

* modular - architecture is split into multiple components, enabling you to run just what you need
* reusable - everything is implemented as Rust crates, making it possible to use different pieces in your project as building blocks
* efficient - :crab:
