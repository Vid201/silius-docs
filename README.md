# Silius

### Introduction

**Silius** is an ERC-4337 (account abstraction) bundler implementation in a highly efficient and safe programming language Rust. But there's more; it's design and architecture are focused on:

* modularity - bundler's architecture is split into multiple components, enabling you to run just what you need
* reusability - everything is implemented as Rust crates, making it possible to use different pieces in your project
* efficiency - :crab:
