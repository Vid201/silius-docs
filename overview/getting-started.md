# Getting started

There are three ways to get started with Silius:

1. Building and running from source.
2. Running in Docker.
3. Using Silius crates in your project.

### Building and running from source

As with other Rust projects, you can build Silius from source with the Cargo package manager. For more information, click [**here**](../tutorials/building-and-running-from-source.md).

### Running in Docker

There is a Docker image available on the [**GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)**](https://github.com/Vid201/silius/pkgs/container/silius) that is updated on an ongoing basis as the new features are developed. For more information, click [**here**](../tutorials/docker.md).

### Using Silius crates in your project

Silius is created from several crates that can be reused and imported into any Rust project. For more information, click [**here**](project-structure.md).
